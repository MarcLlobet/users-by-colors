## Data structure
Dictionary of hosts as keys and a dictionary as value.
Inside, app apdex as keys and a dictionary as value.
Inside, app name as keys and the app as value.

```js
this.hosts[hostName][app.apdex][app.name]
```

It can be seen as a tree of hosts with different layers:

```
     o         - host names
    / \
  o     o      - apdex number
 / \   / \
o   o o   o    - app name (with app as value)
```

### Motivation
- By using objects, the sorting is implicit 
by assigning the apdex number and the app name
- Our data is consumed either by:
  - knowing the host
    - getAppByHostname
    - removeAppByHostname
    - addAppByHostname
  - or by passing the number of apps
    - getAppsByHost (used to return 5 or 25 apps)
- Retrieving information of an app is constant O(1)
- Prevents collisioning

## Big O notation
Traversing from 'apps with hosts' to 'hosts with apps' takes `O(n*h)`,
where n is the number of apps and h is the amount of different hosts.

Sorting Apps: O(1) Implicit with object indexation
Inserting Apps: O(h) â‰ˆ O(1) where h is the height of the tree (which it's 4)
Removing Apps: O(1)
Getting a concrete app: O(1)
Getting n apps by host: O(n*h) where h are hosts and n is the number of apps
